[[building-project-setup]]
=== Project Setup

// TODO: Add the setup info

[[building-prerequisites]]
=== Prerequisites

As prerequisites, you need to have http://www.shellcheck.net/[shellcheck],
https://github.com/sstephenson/bats[bats], https://stedolan.github.io/jq/[jq]
and https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/[ruby] installed. If you use a Linux
machine, `bats` and `shellcheck` are installed for you.

To install the required software on Linux, type the following command:

====
[source,bash]
----
$ sudo apt-get install -y ruby jq
----
====

If you use a Mac, run the following commands to install the missing software:

====
[source,bash]
----
$ brew install jq
$ brew install ruby
$ brew install bats
$ brew install shellcheck
----
====

[[building-bats-submodules]]
=== Bats Submodules

To make `bats` work properly, we needed to attach Git submodules. To have them
initialized, either clone the project or (if you have already cloned the project)
pull to update it. The following command clones the project:

====
[source,bash]
----
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-pipelines.git
----
====

The following commands pull the project:

====
[source,bash]
----
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update
----
====

If you forget about this step, Gradle runs these steps for you.

[[building-build-and-test]]
=== Build and test

Once you have installed all the prerequisites, you can run the following command to build and test the project:

====
[source,bash]
----
$ ./gradlew clean build
----
====

[[building-generate-documentation]]
=== Generate Documentation

To generate the documentation, run the following command:

====
[source,bash]
----
$ ./gradlew generateDocs
----
====

[[building-making-a-release]]
== Releasing the Project

This section covers how to release the project by publishing a Docker image.

=== Publishing A Docker Image

When doing a release, you also need to push a Docker image to Dockerhub.
From the project root, run the following commands, replacing `<version>` with the
version of the release:

====
[source,bash]
----
$ docker login
$ docker build -t cloudpipelines/cloud-pipeline-jenkins:<version> ./jenkins
$ docker push cloudpipelines/cloud-pipeline-jenkins:<version>
----
====

[[building-ci-worker-prerequisites]]
== CI Server Worker Prerequisites

Cloud Pipelines uses Bash scripts extensively. The following list shows the software
that needs to be installed on a CI server worker for the build to pass:

====
[source,bash]
----
 apt-get -y install \
    bash \
    git \
    tar \
    zip \
    curl \
    ruby \
    wget \
    unzip \
    python \
    jq
----
====

TIP: In the demo setup all of these libraries are already installed.
